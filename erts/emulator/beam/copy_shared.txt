0. Assumption: the term to be copied (and all of its subterms)
   is only viewed by the current process.

------------------------------------------------------------------

1. traverse the term and calculate the size;
   when traversing, transform as you do in size_shared
   but when you find shared objects:

   a. add entry in the table, indexed by i

   b. mark them:

      b1. boxed terms, set header to (i | 11)
          store (old header, NONV, NULL, backptr) in the entry
      b2. cons cells, set CDR to NONV, set CAR to i
          store (old CAR, old CDR, NULL, backptr) in the entry

2. allocate new space

3. traverse the term a second time
   when traversing:

   a. if the object is marked as shared

      a1. if the entry contains a forwarding ptr, use that
      a2. otherwise, copy it to the new space and store the
          forwarding ptr to the entry

   b. otherwise, reverse-transform as you do in size_shared
      and copy to the new space

4. traverse the table and reverse-transform all stored entries
